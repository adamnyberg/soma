Run
------

Run the project by using `make solver`.

Local test
------

Run `make test` to test if the project is running correctly.
If you've made changes you'll want to make sure they're represented in `tests/` first.

Server test
------

To run the project on a school server (to test the TJa library, for example), run `make stest id=LIU` (replace LIU with your LiU id, e.g. "danth407") to test if the project is running correctly.
If you've made changes you'll want to make sure they're represented in `tests/` first.
